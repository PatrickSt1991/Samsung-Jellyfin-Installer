## 4. Development Process

### Running Locally & Testing
- The app scans your local network to detect compatible Samsung TVs.  
- For Tizen 7+, a Samsung account is required for certificate generation.  
- Test your changes thoroughly—try both “manually enter IP” and automatic detection.

### Staying Up to Date
- Periodically sync with upstream:
  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/PatrickSt1991/Samsung-Jellyfin-Installer.git
  git fetch upstream
  git rebase upstream/master
  ```
